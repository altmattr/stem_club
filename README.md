# stem_club

This repository is set up assuming that you're using a raspberry pi with a sense hat attached. 

To get it up and running, ```git clone``` this repository, then ```sudo chmod +x stem_club/setup.sh```, ```cd stem_club/``` and ```sudo ./setup.sh```.

After rebooting the pi, you should see the menu show up on the sense hat once the system has rebooted.
